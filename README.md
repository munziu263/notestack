# NoteStack

NoteStack is a journal, composed of a time series stack of your thoughts in text form.

Log in and start recording your thoughts, and NoteStack will log them along with some metadata, most importantly the time.

Slowly you will start building a database of observations, reminders and emotions that you can analyze in your own time later.

For ease of use insert your text with your mobile's audio-to-text transcriber.

Background:

I read an article about someone using GPT-3 to summarize their thoughts on a specific topic by getting it to read through their journal. I was excited about the idea, but I knew that finding the time to journal was beyond me at that stage of my life.

I saw a solution in the audio-to-text transcriber on my iPhone, which was surprisingly accurate. This project hopes to make it easier to capture small thoughts throughout the day, as opposed to setting aside a longer chunk of time in the evening or morning to journal. I hope to implement the reflection step with the help of AI tools.
